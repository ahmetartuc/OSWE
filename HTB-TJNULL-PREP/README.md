# HackTheBox OSWE Preparation

This repository contains my journey and scripts for preparing for the **Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)** certification by solving various HackTheBox machines.

The focus is not just on exploitation, but on **automating the entire process**, including recon, enumeration, and exploitation‚Äîjust like in the OSWE exam.
