# Web Log Analysis & Reporting Tool  

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s This About?
This python script **scans server logs**, **hunts down error messages**, **extracts IP addresses** then **fetches extra data from an API** and finally **spits out a clean JSON and XML report** just for you!  

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Under the Hood? (Libraries in Action)
+ **`re` (Regex - Data Sniper)**  
+ **`requests` (Yeah, we pull data from APIs, so what?)**  
+ **`json` (To store everything neat and clean)**  
+ **`xml.etree.ElementTree` (For XML junkies)**  
+ **`logging` (Because we need to remember our mistakes)**
