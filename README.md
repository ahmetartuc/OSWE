# Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE) Study Sheet üï∑Ô∏è

This repo has all the stuff i've been working on for web security and exploit dev while prepping for my OSWE exam. It's got scripts in **Python**, **PHP**, **Java**, **Node.js** and **C#** that i‚Äôve made to find and exploit vulnerabilities. I created this to keep track of my progress and help out others who are also diving into web app security.

## Contents

### **1. [Python](https://github.com/ahmetartuc/OSWE/Python) (üêç)**
- **Web Security & Exploit Development:**
  - `port-scanner.py`: A basic port scanner.
  - `web-scraper.py`: A web scraping script.
  - `sql-injection.py`: SQL Injection exploitation example.
  - `rce-exploit.py`: Remote Code Execution exploit example.
  - `ssh-brute-force.py`: SSH brute force attack tool.
  
### **2. [PHP](https://github.com/ahmetartuc/OSWE/PHP) (üêò)**
- **Legacy Web Applications & Vulnerabilities:**
  - `php-sql-injection.php`: SQL Injection vulnerable PHP application.
  - `php-file-upload-vuln.php`: File upload vulnerability.
  - `php-xss.php`: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
  
### **3. [Java](https://github.com/ahmetartuc/OSWE/Java) (‚òï)**
- **Enterprise Applications & Security:**
  - `spring-boot-login-vuln`: Simple web application built using Spring Boot.
  - `java-deserialization-exploit.java`: Java deserialization exploit example.
  - `code-review-report.md`: Java code review report.

### **4. [Node.js](https://github.com/ahmetartuc/OSWE/Node.js) (üöÄ)**
- **Modern Web Applications & Security:**
  - `express-js-vuln-app`: Express.js application containing NoSQL Injection and Prototype Pollution.
  - `ssrf-command-injection.js`: SSRF and Command Injection vulnerabilities.
  - `code-review-report.md`: Node.js code review report.

### **5. [C#](https://github.com/ahmetartuc/OSWE/C#) (#Ô∏è‚É£)**
- **Microsoft Ecosystem & Exploit Development:**
  - `asp-net-login-vuln`: ASP.NET application containing ViewState Manipulation and Authentication Bypass.
  - `csharp-deserialization-exploit.cs`: C# deserialization exploit example.
  - `code-review-report.md`: C# code review report.

## Goal

This repo is all about diving deep into **exploit development**, **finding vulnerabilities** and **web app testing** while prepping for OSWE. I‚Äôve been focusing on vulnerabilities in projects written in **Python**, **PHP**, **Java**, **Node.js** and **C#** with the goal of building security tools and exploiting common flaws.
