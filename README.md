# Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE) Study Sheet üï∑Ô∏è
## *** Entirely AI-Generated ***

This repo has all the stuff i've been working on for web security and exploit dev while prepping for my OSWE exam. It's got scripts in **Python**, **PHP**, **Java**, **Node.js** and **C#** that i‚Äôve made to find and exploit vulnerabilities. I created this to keep track of my progress and help out others who are also diving into web app security.

## Contents

  - `code-review-report.md`: C# code review report.

## Goal

This repo is all about diving deep into **exploit development**, **finding vulnerabilities** and **web app testing** while prepping for OSWE. I‚Äôve been focusing on vulnerabilities in projects written in **Python**, **PHP**, **Java**, **Node.js** and **C#** with the goal of building security tools and exploiting common flaws.
